## C02:

## Particulate Matter [3]:
This is a mixture of solid and liquid particles that are suspended in the air. These are categorized into coarse, fine and ultrafine. PM2.5 are fine particles that have a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers (more than 100 times thinner than a human hair) and remain suspended in the air for longer durations. The health risk with PM2.5 is that they can travel deep into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs and entering the blood stream.

## Location:
Place the monitor at head height and keep them away from [1]:
- windows
- doors
- air supply openings
Position the monitors over 50cm away from people as their exhaled breath contains CO2. If your monitor is too close it may give a misleadingly high reading.

## CO2 Air Quality Levels [2]:
- 250-400ppm	Normal background concentration in outdoor ambient air
- 400-1,000ppm	Concentrations typical of occupied indoor spaces with good air exchange
- 1,000-2,000ppm	Complaints of drowsiness and poor air.
- 2,000-5,000 ppm	Headaches, sleepiness and stagnant, stale, stuffy air. Poor concentration, loss of attention, increased heart rate and slight nausea may also be present.
- 5,000	Workplace exposure limit (as 8-hour TWA) in most jurisdictions.
- 40,000+ ppm	Exposure may lead to serious oxygen deprivation resulting in permanent brain damage, coma, even death.
note CO2 measurements are only a broad guide to ventilation rather than demonstrating 'safe levels'

## Particle Air Quality Levels [3]:
- 0-12 μg/m3 Long term safe level
- 35+ μg/m3 Shart term acceptable level however during a 24-hour period air is considered unhealthy and can cause issues for people with existing breathing issues such as asthma
- 50+ μg/m3 Prolonged exposure to levels above can lead to serious health issues and premature mortality

# Background

## The Reason For This Project:
Most commercial indoor air quality (IAQ) sensors are designed for the office environment. They can be costly to purchase and install, and often requiring multiple expensive sensor to monitor the level of pollutants in the air, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter.

This project aims to exploit a gap in the market as a scaled back cheaper option for a company to role out to their employees working from home, as according to the Governments Health and Safety Executive [1]:
>As an employer, you have the same health and safety responsibilities for people working at home as for any other worker.

This will allow the employee to monitor their home office and be notified to take action to reduce exposure to pollutants in the air. This is both to the benift of the employee and employer.

## C02[2]:
The outdoor air in most locations contains down to about 380 parts per million carbon dioxide but higher outdoor CO2 concentrations can be found near vehicle traffic areas, industry and sources of combustion. Elevated indoors levels are primarily from peoples breath indoors. Without adequate ventilation to dilute and remove the CO2 being continuously generated by the occupants, CO2 can accumulate. This can have a detrimental effect on work as symptoms such as tiredness, lack of focus take effect.

### CO2 Air Quality Levels [3]:
- 250-400ppm	Normal background concentration in outdoor ambient air
- 400-1,000ppm	Concentrations typical of occupied indoor spaces with good air exchange
- 1,000-2,000ppm	Complaints of drowsiness and poor air.
- 2,000-5,000 ppm	Headaches, sleepiness and stagnant, stale, stuffy air. Poor concentration, loss of attention, increased heart rate and slight nausea may also be present.
- 5,000	Workplace exposure limit (as 8-hour TWA) in most jurisdictions.
- 40,000+ ppm	Exposure may lead to serious oxygen deprivation resulting in permanent brain damage, coma, even death.
note CO2 measurements are only a broad guide to ventilation rather than demonstrating 'safe levels'

## Particulate Matter [4]:
This is a mixture of solid and liquid particles that are suspended in the air. These are categorized into coarse, fine and ultrafine. PM2.5 are fine particles that have a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers (more than 100 times thinner than a human hair) and remain suspended in the air for longer durations. The health risk with PM2.5 is that they can travel deep into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs and entering the blood stream.

### Particle Air Quality Levels [4]:
- 0-12 μg/m3 Long term safe level
- 35+ μg/m3 Short term acceptable level however during a 24-hour period air is considered unhealthy and can cause issues for people with existing breathing issues such as asthma
- 50+ μg/m3 Prolonged exposure to levels above can lead to serious health issues and premature mortality

## Placement [5]:
Locate the monitor at head height and keep it away from:
- windows
- doors
- air supply openings
Position the monitors over 50cm away from people as their exhaled breath contains CO2. If your monitor is too close it may give a misleadingly high reading.

# Implementation:
## Hardware:
- MICS-VZ-89TE VOC Sensor IAQ Module
- SN-GCJA5 Sensor Particle Matter (with connector cable)
- STM32F407G-DISC1 Discovery Board
- 2x 4k7 resistors
- 10x LEDS
- 10x 100 ohm resistors
- USB PCB board
- 5v USB power supply
- Case
- Jumper wires
- Pin Headers

### Setup:
![Circuit Design](https://github.com/JasperWH/VZ89TE-SN_GCJA5-Air-Quality-Sensor/blob/main/Pictures/Air_quality_Sensor_Circuit_Diagram.PNG)
The user manual recomends:
>The 5V and 3V pins deliver a 5 V or 3 V power supply and power consumption must be lower than 100 mA.

This project draws more that 200mA just through the LEDs, so for any long term use it is recommend to use a transistor to act as a digital switch and run everything straight from a 5v and 3.3v power supply.

## Software:
- STMCubeIDE

### Setup:
![STM32Cube setup](https://github.com/JasperWH/VZ89TE-SN_GCJA5-Air-Quality-Sensor/blob/main/Pictures/Air_quality_Sensor_STM32_setup.PNG)

### Code:
This programme has been written in C, no external libraries to STM32IDE need to be downloaded to run this application. If you wish to use printf while getting it running you'll need to copy the contents of syscalls.c into your file of the same name. You will also need to change the clock speed when debugging to 25kHz

The C02 and Particulate matter (PM) LED indication level draws from the values above:
| Level  | PM (μg/m3) | C02 (ppm) |
| ------ | ---------- | --------- |
| Green  | 10         | 400       |
| Blue   | 20         | 650       |
| Orange | 30         | 900       |
| Orange | 40         | 1150      |
| Red    | 50         | 1400      |

# I2C Communication:
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a serial communication protocol that is used to connect multiple devices together in a system. I2C uses two wires to establish communication between devices: a data line (SDA) and a clock line (SCL). The master device controls the clock line and initiates communication with the slave devices. Each slave device on the bus has a unique address, and the master device uses this address to communicate with the desired slave device.

One of the key features of I2C is that it is a multi-master bus, which means that multiple devices can act as masters on the bus and initiate communication with slave devices. This allows for a flexible system design and enables multiple devices to communicate with each other simultaneously.

I2C is widely used in embedded systems, industrial control systems and consumer electronics. It is widely supported by microcontrollers and other integrated circuits, and it is often used to interface with sensors, displays, and other peripherals. I2C is a relatively simple and low-cost communication protocol, which makes it well-suited for use in small and portable devices.

## Implementation:
Please refer to the sensor communication manuals to get the required slave address' and data registers for your application.
